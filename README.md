### Getting Started

This project was created using [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express.JS](https://expressjs.com/).


### Prerequisites

To have a local copy of this project up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following
software/libraries/plugins

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Download and install Node, which also includes NPM(Node Package Manager).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Download and install VS Code or any Editor/IDE(Integrated Development Environment) of your choice. - Optional

See the following section for step-by-step instructions on how to install these software/libraries/plugins.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.
For this project we use Node + NPM.

- Head to the official Node website to download and install Node, which also includes NPM.
- Select the "Recommended For Most Users" button and download the current version for your Operating System.
- After you download and install Node, open command prompt/terminal and run the following commands to check if everything works:
  _`node -version`_
  _`npm -version`_
- To run the application, change to the directory where the app was installed using "cd <folder_name>".
- Run "npm install" to install all the dependencies used by the app.
- Finally, run "npm start" to see the app live on the localhost.

### Deployment

I deployed the application on Heroku by connecting the Heroku server with my Github account. When the code is uploaded to Github then Heroku automatically deploys the application on the cloud platform.
